/**
 * This fix addresses potential issues with the canvas container size.
 * If the canvas container doesn't have a defined size, the canvas will be initialized
 * with width and height of 0, making the grid invisible even if it's being drawn.
 */

// The changes needed:

// 1. Ensure the canvas container has a defined size in CanvasEditor.jsx:
// In the return statement, add explicit styling to the canvas container:
/*
<div className="canvas-container relative w-full h-full bg-gray-50 overflow-hidden"
     style={{ width: '100%', height: 'calc(100vh - 120px)' }}>
*/

// 2. Log canvas dimensions in setupCanvas:
/*
console.log('Canvas dimensions:', {
  width: canvas.width,
  height: canvas.height,
  containerWidth: container.clientWidth,
  containerHeight: container.clientHeight
});
*/

// 3. Ensure the component containing the CanvasEditor has a defined height:
// Check App.jsx or the parent component that contains the CanvasEditor
