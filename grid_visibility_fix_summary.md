# Grid Visibility Fix Summary

## Problem
The grid in the Red Iron MTO App was not visible despite code changes that should have enhanced its visibility.

## Diagnosis and Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Grid Colors
- Changed inch grid from `#e5e7eb` → `#c7cbd1` → `#a1a1aa` (increasingly darker)
- Changed feet grid from `#d1d5db` → `#9ca3af` → `#71717a` (increasingly darker)
- Changed 5-foot grid from `#9ca3af` → `#6b7280` → `#3f3f46` (increasingly darker)
- Changed 10-foot grid from `#6b7280` → `#4b5563` → `#18181b` (increasingly darker)

### 2. Increased Line Widths
- Increased inch grid from 0.8px → 1.0px → 1.5px
- Increased feet grid from 1.0px → 1.5px → 2.0px
- Increased 5-foot grid from 1.2px → 2.0px → 2.5px
- Increased 10-foot grid from 1.5px → 2.5px → 3.0px
- Also increased major grid lines for feet when showing inch grid to 2.0px

### 3. Added Canvas Initialization
- Added explicit useEffect hooks to ensure canvas is properly initialized
- Added window resize handler to ensure canvas updates when window size changes
- Added debugging console logs to track canvas initialization and grid drawing

### 4. Fixed Canvas Size Issues
- Added explicit dimensions to canvas container: `style={{ width: '100%', height: 'calc(100vh - 120px)' }}`
- Added console logging for canvas dimensions to verify size

### 5. Added Grid Border Debug Visualization
- Added a magenta border around the entire grid area for easy visibility
- Enhanced origin crosshairs (0,0 point)

### 6. Fixed AppContext Grid Toggle
- Added state to dependency array in toggleGrid callback
- Added debug logging throughout grid state management

## Results
These changes significantly enhance grid visibility by:
1. Using much bolder, more contrasting colors
2. Using much thicker lines at all zoom levels
3. Ensuring the canvas is properly initialized
4. Ensuring the canvas has proper dimensions
5. Adding visual debugging aids

The grid should now be clearly visible at all zoom levels, with a clear visual hierarchy between inch, foot, 5-foot, and 10-foot grid lines.
